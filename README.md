# Intro_to_AI
This repository contains all the programming work done by Ian Feekes (ianfeekes@gmail.com) for the University of San Diego MS. Applied Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program's Intro to AI class.

## Genetic Algorithm
The code written in ```genetic_algorithm.py``` explores how the parameters of a genetic algorithm can allow convergence towards a "fitness" metric using randomly-generated binary genomes of varying sequence length

## Image Analysis
The code written in ```image_analysis.py``` explores image data with rgb and grayscale matrices. It exemplifies the code behind adjusting contrast in images, and performs binary thresholdings at various thresholds for an image ```SanDiego.jpg```
